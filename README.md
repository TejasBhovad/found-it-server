> Aggregate job postings from Wellfound and save them locally

Proof of concept for a job aggregator. The script scrapes job postings from the Wellfound job board and returns a list of job postings in JSON format. The script is written in Python and uses the BeautifulSoup library to scrape the job postings. It uses FastAPI to create a REST API that returns the job postings in JSON format. The script can be run locally or deployed to a server.

This repo will be deleted after the project is completed.
